## plenoptomos

Plenoptic imaging reconstruction tools, developed in the context of the VOXEL project, part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (VOXEL H2020-FETOPEN-2014-2015-RIA GA 665207).  
It provides a Python package that allows to read and manipulate light-field images

## dct

Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) reconstruction software.
It provides a set of matlab functions and GUIs that allow to ingest, process and reconstruct DCT scans (mainly acquired at ESRF - The European Synchrotron).  
I started contributing to the DCT code in Nov 2011, as part of my PhD project, founded by the French research agency ANR (ANR 2010 BLAN 0935).
My most significant contributions are represented by the 6D grain reconstruction algorithms and code.
