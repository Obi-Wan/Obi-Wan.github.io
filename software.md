## plenoptomos

Plenoptic imaging reconstruction tools, developed in the context of the VOXEL project, part of the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (VOXEL H2020-FETOPEN-2014-2015-RIA GA 665207).  
It provides a Python package that allows to read and manipulate light-field images

## dct

Diffraction Contrast Tomography (DCT) reconstruction software.
It provides a set of matlab functions and GUIs that allow to ingest, process and reconstruct DCT scans (mainly acquired at ESRF - The European Synchrotron).  
I started contributing to the DCT code in Nov 2011, as part of my PhD project, founded by the French research agency ANR (ANR 2010 BLAN 0935).
My most significant contributions are represented by the 6D grain reconstruction algorithms and code.

## PyCorrectedEmissionCT

Physically corrected projectors for X-ray induced emission CT.

It contains the code used for the following paper, which also provides a mathematical description of the concepts and algorithms used here:

## PyRMLSeg

A Python package that implements relaxed multi-levelset segmentation, with tomographically consistent refinement.

It contains the code used for the following paper, which also provides a mathematical description of the concepts and algorithms used here:

## freeart

FreeART is a tomographic reconstruction library leveraging Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), for the reconstuction of absorption and induced emission sinograms (XRD-CT and XRF-CT).
Freeart core is written in C++, but a python interface is also provided.

I bootstrapped FreeART in Oct 2010, as part of my MSc internship at ESRF, and supervised the developments for the following few years.
